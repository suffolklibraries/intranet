# Suffolk Libraries intranet themes

This is a child of the [Genesis Framework](https://my.studiopress.com/themes/genesis/), based on the [Genesis Sample Theme](https://github.com/copyblogger/genesis-sample/).


## How it works

Intranet is a child theme. The only modifications are contained in the Suffolk Libraries section of `style.css`. There are all sorts of horrors here because of how WordPress and Genesis structure HTML and CSS.


## Workflow

1. Make changes to a local working branch
2. Merge into the `candidate` branch
3. Push the `candidate` branch
4. Merge `candidate` locally
5. Review or reject
6. If needs external review, FTP to test site and get approval
6. Merge into `master`
7. Push `master`
8. FTP to live site


## Dependencies
